# Getting Started With Project 3

This project uses a simpler configuration that does not use Eleventy
(though you are welcome to add it yourself).

The input file `src/tailwind.css` compiles to `docs/styles/tailwind.css`,
but the rest of the files for the site have been placed directly in the
`docs/` directory.


Install and start the project:

```shell-session
$ npm install
$ npm start

```

Open the [newly generated site](http://localhost:3000/)

A new `npm test` script lints the code and enforces
[JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).
